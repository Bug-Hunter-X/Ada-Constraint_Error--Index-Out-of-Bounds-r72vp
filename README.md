# Ada Constraint_Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common programming error in Ada: accessing an array element outside its defined bounds.  The `bug.ada` file contains code that attempts to access an element beyond the array's limits, causing a `Constraint_Error` exception.  The solution, `bugSolution.ada`, shows how to prevent this error using proper index bounds checking.
